## Behavior

* A generative model: the machine will learn to execute and produce most likely data sequences conditioned on a fixed sequence of past data.
* Learning while executing: like LSTMs, the machine can keep information up to an arbitary step into the past; while like condition models, it only needs to be trained stepwise. 
* The machine accepts the very first data sequences as the inputs and learns from them.
