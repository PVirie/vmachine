### Behavior

* A generative model: the machine will learn to execute and produce most likely data sequences conditioned on past data.
* Learning while executing: the machine accepts the very first data sequences as the inputs and learns from them.
* Make decision when to learn more: the machine outputs a flag that tells external environment to feed more input data when it is not sure what to think next.
